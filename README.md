## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Weather Detection**  
   WeatherLofi uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data based on your location or search input.

2. **Music Playlist's**  
   The app categorizes weather conditions (rain, sun, snow, etc.) and has a playlist designed to complement each type. For example:
   - 🌧️ **Rainy Days** → Chill, mellow beats  
   - ☀️ **Sunny Afternoons** → Bright, uplifting lofi  
   - ❄️ **Snowy Evenings** → Soft, cozy instrumentals  

3. **Visual Adaptation**  
   Dynamic visuals and transitions provide an immersive, weather-responsive UI that evolves with the forecast.
